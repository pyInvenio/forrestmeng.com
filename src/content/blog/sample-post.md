This is a sample blog post written in **markdown** using mdsvex.

## Features

- Write posts in markdown instead of raw Svelte components
- Frontmatter for metadata (title, date, tags, description)
- Automatic SEO tags and JSON-LD structured data
- Tailwind Typography styling via the `prose` class

## Code Example

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello from mdsvex!';
console.log(greeting);
```

## Conclusion

New blog posts can now be created as `.md` files in `src/content/blog/` instead of hand-coding Svelte components.
