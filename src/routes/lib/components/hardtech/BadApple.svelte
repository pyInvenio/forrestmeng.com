		<p>
			Bad Apple! is a song by Japanese rock band "Neru" from their album "Neru Asobi". The song is
            known for its fast-paced and catchy tune, and is often used as a meme in the Japanese
            culture. The song is also known for its music video, which is a 3 minute long video of
            animated apples falling from the sky. The video is known for its high frame rate, and is
            often used as a benchmark for video playback. This video is parodied in many ways, such as
            being played on a calculator, or being played on a 3D printer.

            I'm starting to use Bad Apple as a benchmark for my projects, seeing how far I can push
            hardware and software solutions.
