		<p>
			For my project in ECE 2804 project, I decided to build a SpO2 calculator circuit from scratch.
			The circuit is based on the photodiodic method of measuring SpO2, which is the most common
			method used in hospitals. The photodiode emits a red light and measures the amount of light
			absorbed by the blood. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the amount of oxygen in
			the blood, as well as the heart rate. I had to design the circuit to be able to convert the
			current into a voltage that could be read by an Arduino, which runs the calculation code. I
			also had to design the circuit to be able to filter out noise.
