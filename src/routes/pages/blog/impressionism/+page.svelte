				The influence of Degas and Impressionism on art interpretation and modern expression.

				Edgar Degas watched as Jules Perrot instructed a class of ballet dancers in the Paris Opera,
				applying a stroke of paint as Perrot wrapped up the lesson right in front of him. Degas and other
				impressionist artists established one of the most important movements of art expression through
				plein air (open air) painting, capturing the momentary effects of light and movement of a natural
				scene.

				<br /><br />Degas is considered a founding artist in the impressionist art movement,
				originating in the 19th century in France, characterized by many visible brush strokes, open
				composition, and a focus on capturing the natural and fleeting moment in front of the
				artist. Claude Monet’s Impressionism, Sunrise, gave birth to the name of the movement; many
				conventional artists at the time hated the movement, calling it unfinished and imperfect.

				<img src="/impress2.jpg" alt="" />Impressionism works are characterized by impasto painting,
				where brush strokes are easily seen on the canvas since paint was applied in thicker layers
				with shorter brush strokes. Colors are made more vibrant through the use of the contrast
				effect, where artists applied colors with as little mixing as possible next to each other.
				There were a lot more soft edges as well, as paint was applied wet on wet. Shadows being
				cooler and painted with the sky’s blue became more common. Black paint was rejected heavily
				as well; to get darker tones and grays, complementary colors were blended together. For
				example, I’ve used crimson red + yellow + ultramarine for a dark brown color. Adding more
				ultramarine and a bit more red would make the color practically black, and this color could
				be adjusted by adding varying amounts of white and yellow.

				<br /><br />By portraying visual effects and realistic scenes of life and environments,
				rather than smoothly shaded and perfected still lifes inside a studio, impressionists broke
				the rules of academic painting to capture movement and an immediacy of a scene. As an event
				photographer, I find it very analogous to candid photography, where by immersing yourself in
				the environment, one could capture in-the-moment scenes and expressions with natural poses
				and unique angles. Take, for instance, Degas’ Musicians in the Orchestra painting.

				<br /><br /><img src="/impress3.jpg" alt="" />Degas himself was a critique of impressionism,
				actually belittling the practice of plein air and is inspired by previous great masters and
				Japanese prints. However, his work could be considered the most Impressionist-like,
				capturing original observation in everyday life, from dynamic ballet dancers to darker
				scenes, such as in the painting Interior. Nevertheless, his work, along with many other
				impressionists, have influenced art forms we see often even today.
				<br /><br />
				<h1>Impressionism’s impressions today</h1>
				Impressionism directly paved the way for future artistic movements like neo-impressionism, fauvism,
				cubism, and modernism, but also has provided unique inspiration and developments for other types
				of art and design systems.
				<br /><br />A low hanging fruit of the lasting effects of impressionism is visible in
				photography and cinematography. Plein air painting focused on artists capturing ephemeral
				qualities of light and atmosphere in fleeting moments. This practice had a significant
				impact in the photographic and cinematic practices when cameras were invented alongside the
				birth of the movement. People realized that capturing fleeting moments were interesting and
				sometimes more desired than posed, perfectionist “romantic” art. Early on, photographers in
				the modernist movement, like Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, were heavily influenced
				by the in situ experience of impressionism art. It is clearly shown in Steichen’s fashion
				and WWII photography work, actively striving to capture movement and unique angles.

				<img src="/impress4.jpg" alt="" />
				French and German avant-garde impressionism movements also stemmed from the works of Degas and
				Cezanne and the likes, focusing on more evoking underlying emotions and using film as an art
				form for the sake of art. More recently, movies such as Amelie, by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, have an
				impressionists’ focus on more surreal sensory experiences and emotional intensity.

				<img src="/impress5.jpg" alt="" />UI and modern design systems have been influenced by
				impressionism as well, specifically how designers approach color, contrast, visual
				hierarchy, and component design. Right away, we can see color practices in pop-art,
				post-modern, and retro style design systems stemmed from impressionism and modernism’s
				contrast and vibrancy, as seen in Paula Scher’s designs:

				<img src="/impress6.jpg" alt="" />However, more subtly in web and application design, the
				recent surface of Cosmic UI and Material opposed the skeumorphism that was so prevalent in
				the 2000s. Cosmic UI and Material design focus on minimalism but also effects such as
				parallax, gradients, and bright accent colors to provide texture and a sense of
				three-dimensionality without pure realism.

				<img src="/impress7.jpg" alt="" />Additionally, the use of impressionist texture and color
				as a contrast to more simple typefaces, blocks, and cards on sites, creating visually
				amazing and interesting juxtapositions. Through photobashing, filters, noise, and bright
				colors, site design could bring a lot more emotion and impact to a simple interface. These
				types of designs also suggest engagement and interaction from a user compared to traditional
				design.

				<img src="/impress8.jpg" alt="" />Many gaming and immersive experiences pay homage to
				impressionist styles and ideals as well. In exhibits like Artechouse DC and Van Gogh,
				visiters are put into an impressionist’s work with flowing and moving images of colorful,
				contrasting environments. Interactive art exhibits often bring viewers into the middle of
				the art piece, holding the fleeting actions of an interaction as part of the beauty a piece
				wants to convey.

				<img src="/impress9.jpg" alt="" />Video games are another outlet for where impressionism has
				impacted development patterns and advancements in its creative expression. Seeking to create
				immersive and engaging worlds that are full of sensory detail and nuance, many games of the
				“ambient” and open world genre use light, color, and atmosphere to create emotional and
				aesthetic experiences that are inspired by the impressionist approach to art. Journey is one
				of the many examples of how impressionist concepts of depicting atmosphere and lighting can
				improve a game’s immersive and emotional feel.

				<h1>Art in its Truest Form</h1>
				<img src="/impress11.jpg" alt="" />Impressionism is a beacon of light in the history of art,
				a movement that forever changed our perception of the world and our place in it. Through
				their vibrant and emotive paintings, the impressionists sought to capture the essence of
				life, to freeze a moment in time and imbue it with a sense of immediacy and depth.

				<br /><br />What makes impressionism so powerful is its focus on the fleeting moments that
				make up our lives, the memories and emotions that linger long after the event has passed. By
				painting "photographs on canvas," the impressionists were able to capture the essence of
				these moments with a clarity and precision that had never been seen before. They understood
				that life is a series of moments, each one fleeting and ephemeral, and sought to capture the
				magic and beauty of these moments in their paintings.

				<br /><br />In my opinion, impressionism was the inflection point that marked the beginning
				of a new era in art, one in which artists were free to explore their own emotions and
				experiences without being bound by the dictates of tradition or society, a belief that
				strongly is held throughout fauvism, post-modernism, and contemporary movements. With the
				contributions of Degas, Renoir, and many others, more creatives create art for art’s sake,
				embedding the aesthetics and emotional factors beyond the canvas and into every day media
				and design.
